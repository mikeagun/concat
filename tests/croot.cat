[1.0 3/^] \croot def
# [      - start of code block (so now we aren't executing code but collecting code into a block for later execution)
# 1.0    - push 1 as a floating point number (otherwise the / that comes later would do integer divide)
# 3 / ^  - push 3, then divide 1 by 3 to get 1/3, then take cubed root of top of stack (by raising to 1/3)
# ]      - end of code block (so at this point the code block [1.0 3/^] is currently the top of the stack)
# \croot - escaped word (so instead of trying to execute croot as an operator, it will push the operator name onto the stack)
# def - define a new operator with top as the word and second as the definition

#now we can use croot like any other operator
